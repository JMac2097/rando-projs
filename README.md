# rando-projs

The plan here is to have a collection of work that will not only encorage me to use Guthub more than I have, but to also collect together projects that will be useful for personal study.

Item so far:

~ Fetch Helper - Basic so far, but is a good example of using async to get a basic bit of data back from an API.

~ ToDo - Vanilla JS todo list (duh), that stores todos to the screen.. Intension here is to expand and get some local storage on there, and maybe some ajaxing content.
