# rando-projs

The plan here is to have a collection of work that will not only encorage me to use Guthub more than I have, but to also collect together projects that will be useful for personal study.

Item so far:

~ Fetch Helper - Basic so far, but is a good example of using async to get a basic bit of data back from an API.

~ ToDo - Vanilla JS todo list (duh), that stores todos to the screen.. Got some local storage in there and all that good stuff, details reload in after page refresh.
Wanting to add in editing options next.

~ Transitions -- Using Googles View Transition API
Notes:
After trying to ork with CRA app, I have found that it is not only slow, it was also wanting my PC to use a previous version of Webpack, non.
So will attempt again using Vite
